Important:

1. Avoid hardcoded stuff
2. Follow existing patterns in the code base
3. Always follow best practice
4. look up resources to know better
5. edit files in small batches rather than large ones
6. look up the lib files in the node modules folder
7. we want no backwards compatibiltiy, keep progressing
